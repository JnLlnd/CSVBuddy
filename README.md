You can load files with all sort of field delimiters (comma, tad, semi-colon, etc.) and encapsulators (double/single-quotes or any other character). Convert line breaks in data field making your file XL ready. Rename/reorder fields, add or edit records, save with any delimiters and export to fixed-width, HTML templates or XML formats. Freeware.
